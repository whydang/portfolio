		"Misc Description": "I participated in the Animation Capstone at UW and got a first-hand feel at what the production pipeline required. But the most important thing I took out of this was that teamwork is essential to move forward. The people I worked with were outstanding and the story we've given life to spoke with actions more than words. Although it's hardly finalized, the amount of effort put into the film was rewarding."

		"Misc Description": "I work part-time as an Introductory Programming Teaching Assistant in CSE department at the University of Washington. Enrollment in these courses are increasing by the quarter, and the more I work with students curious about technology, the more I've realized that teaching is something that I am passionate about. I wish to become a professor in the near future once I've explored the world enough to gain experience and earn credentials."
